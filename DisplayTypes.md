## Displays

**Types of panels**

* Plasma
* LCD
* LED
* OLED
* QLED

#### *Plasma*
Plasma displays use small ionized gas cells to depict images. They produce the deepest blacks, low motion blur, and very less expensive compared to LCD.

Plasma's have an issue with screen burn in and can't be used at certain elevations.

Plasma televisions have been discontinued in 2014 and are very rare to find now.

#### *LCD*

LCD stands for liquid-crystal display. The panel uses light modulating liquid crystals.

It produces sharp images, low heat, and is energy efficient best if you want to conserve your battery power.

#### *LED*

LED displays uses light-emitting diode (LED) as pixels for display. They are bright and allow consumers to use them outdoors and in direct sunlight so there is no glare when viewing.

#### *OLED*

OLED stands for organic light-emitting diode.

It is provides a better pictures because each pixel produces light, more power efficient, lightweight, and will be cheaper in the future.

The downside is that they do not have a long life span and get old real fast as they are always updating displays.

#### *QLED*

QLED displays uses quantum dots on the image.

They are one of the brightest displays and is lightweight. The life span is much longer than OLED but also uses much more battery power to display the images.
